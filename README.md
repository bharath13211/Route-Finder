Part 1: The 2021 Puzzle->
--------------------

Problem given to us is to obtain goal state from the given state using the pre-defined rotations like particular row/column 
can rotate only in particular direction.
Pre-defined rotations given to us are: 

* 1st and 3rd rows can rotate only in LEFT direction
* 2nd and 4th rows can rotate only in RIGHT direction
* 1st, 3rd and 5th columns can rotate only in UP direction
* 2nd and 4th columns can rotate only in DOWN direction

##### Problem statement
Here, input will be given in form of 1-D array with 20 elements. We divided this into 4X5 2-D array with 4-Rows and 5-Columns. 
Using the pre-defined rotations, our goal is to obtain goal state which is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]. 

##### Successor function
Here, we have implemented a successor function which takes current state as input and it gives all possible next states as output. 
In the successor function, we have used in-built python rotate function to rotate the particular row/column in particular direction. 
We have also appended the the rotation direction of child node along with the state while storing the successors, to provide the output path if goal state is obtained.

##### Heauristic function
Here, we have used cost evaluation function f(s) = h(s)+g(s) where h(s)-cost from current state to goal state and g(s) is cost from intial satate to current state.
The heauristic(h(s)) we used in this problme is calculating the misplaced tiles at each state.
g(s) is number of steps it to obtain from intial state to current state. 

Here, misplaced tiles is admissible because it's value reduce everytime when we move to next state. 
If we consider the manhattan distance as heauristic, it fails to be admissible for edge column values.
(For the last column values, even though we can reach its goal positiojn by one rotation.... manhattan distance will be four instead of  one)


### a brief description of how your search algorithm works:

Here, our algorithm will take intial/given state as input. 
We have created a fring(Priority Queue) which will pop the priority element first. 
Popped element element from fringe have 4 parameters. (cost evaluation value(h+g), current state, Direction to reach current state, value of g)
While fringe is not empty, will iterate through the elements in fringe and will check if goal state is obtained. 
If it reached goal state, we will terminate the code and return the path/directions to reach goal state from initisal state. 
Else, algorithm will find the successor states of current state using the successor function implemented and it will append them to fringe.

### discussion of any problems faced, simplifcations, and/or design decisions made.

At the start, we have tried many heauristic functions like manhattan distance, Inversion count, Manhattan+Linear conflict. 
But we got either wrong output or many times program went in to infinite loop. 
Also, we struggled with the successor function like how to rotate only one row/column and also in storing the path/direction.

In the solver function, input is giving in form of tuple but we converted that data type into list for our operations and simplicity.

Part 2: Road Trip!->
--------------------

## Design

* As traversing through the huge network of cities in US map is hard the traditional methods of Breadth First Search(BFS) and Depth First Search(DFS) takes huge amount of time for planning out the route so, we come across the better version by calculating the heuristic value and using A* Search.

* The state space in this case will be all possible routes from the source to destination.

* The successor function in this case will be the function which returns the intermediate cities of source city before reaching destination and also which returns destination city.

* The edge weights are considered in the format g(s), the value of g(s) will be same to all the nodes on same level and gets incremented by 1 after travelling to next node.

* The goal state will be the destination city.

* The heuristic value h(s) will be depending on the heuristic chosen in our case there are four heuristic functions(number of segments, number of miles, time taken and the probability of accident).
In this case all the four heuristics are admissible as the values are predefined in question itself and the values are never overestimated and are fixed.



## Program Description

* The first step is loading road segments and we stored in a dictionary of dictionary format for easy access where the first key is the start_city and the second key is end_city which consists of the values number of miles, speed limit and the highway name

* After that we load the co-ordinates of the cities.

* We have four types of cost function number of segments, distance, time and safety so we wrote a function which returns the cost value depending on the input we give.

* For calculating the distance between we the two cities we considered Euclidean method.

* Now for getting the route we defined an empty fringe and inserted initial state which has priority index value which was calculated depending on the heuristic considered, route which is start_city, number of miles which is 0, number of segments which is 0, number of accidents which is 0 and time taken which will be zero initially.

* So depending on the sum of heuristic value and cost function(g) and the destination that user has to go, the fringe gets popped out of the priority queue and then the successor states get added to fringe and finally when we pop out the destination from the fringe we will terminate the program and then return the output in the required format.

## problems faced.
* Initially when we tried to import data from raw data files, we faced lot of difficulty on which data structure can give us better results like whether to use dictionary or 2D-array or other.
* Among the 4 heuristic parameters given(time, segments, distance, safety), calculating segments took more efforts from us compared to other three.

Part 3: Choosing Teams->
--------------------

* The problem poses a search optimization technique to assign students into groups according to their preferences and 
  raise complaints if there occurs an assignment error.
  
* Our goal is to assign students into groups that would minimize the total number of complaints raised by students.

#### SEARCH ABSTRACTION : 
The search abstraction used in solving this problem is defined below
* The state space in this case will consist of all the possible teams that can be formed along with their assignment 
  cost(number of complaints raised).
  
* Initial State : In this case we considered the initial state to be the teams formed according to the given preference
  listed by the students
  
* Successor States (Function) : Our successor function will return assigned teams by randomly choosing students from the 
  list and creates a new set of teams.
  
* Goal State : Our goal is to form teams such that the assigned cost will be as minimum as possible.
  
* Heuristic h(s) : the heuristic in this case is the calculation of the total assignment cost(number of complaints raised)
  considering the following scenarios 
  * If there is a difference between the group size that a student requested and the group size that the student got 
    placed in then a complaint is raised.
  * If a student is not assigned to a team as requested in his preference list then a complaint is raised for each 
    different team member assigned to him. 
  * If a student is assigned to a group from their non-preference list then two complaint emails are raised.

#### OVERVIEW OF THE SOLUTION (route_pichu):
* The solver function takes input file consisting of a list of student data with their preference,non-preference team 
  members and team size which is stored into a default dictionary.
  
* We used priority queue to implement the search algorithm (A* search) with heuristic as the assigned cost value of the 
  teams formed and the successor function will assign random teams.
  
* The calculate_assigned_cost method will return the total cost value of the assigned teams based on the conditions 
  defined in the above heuristic function.
  
* Valid state function will return a first initial state for appending into the fringe.

* Is_goal method will validate whether all the students are assigned into teams or not.

* Successor states from the fringe will be
